    <h1 class="headline">The threat of the Green Revolution on traditional farming practices, and agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa*</h1>
    <p class="subline" >Based on the arguments of Kofi Annan</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Kofi Annan, suggests that a Green Revolution is necessary for Africa to improve its agriculture practices. Five ways Annan‚Äôs approach threatens traditional farming practices, and agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa is a high cost of farming, displacement and inequality, loss of farmer independence, health and biodiversity repercussions from genetically modified seeds and negative impacts on the environment.</p>

<p><strong>High Cost of Farming</strong></p>

<p>One way which Annan‚Äôs approach presents a threat is the financial strain it puts on farmers. The Green Revolution presents a high incremental cost of farming associated with adapting its practices. Every season farmers would have to purchase seeds, chemicals and fertilizers. This would be a stark contrast for the 80% of farmers who currently use saved seeds to limit seasonal purchasing<a href="#_ftn1">&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;[1]&lt;![endif]&gt;</a>. This financial strain is further exemplified with the high cost of fertilizers. The cost of fertilizers in Sub-Saharan Africa is almost 4 times more than in European countries and increases in proportionality to distance<a href="#_ftn2">&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;[2]&lt;![endif]&gt;</a>. Consequently, farmers would experience decreased profitability from high costs and distanced landlocked countries, which are the most in need of improved accessibility, would experience the greatest burden of cost. With consideration of these financial demands and the additional inputs required for equipment and machinery, many farmers would not be able to afford adoption of these practices with many needing to take on debt.</p>

<p><strong>Labour &amp; Land displacement</strong></p>

<p>A second threat presented by Annan‚Äôs approach is labour and land displacement. The primary objective for the Green Revolution is to drastically improve production and yields through mechanisms that parallel industrial farming. This high-yield push increases demand for land and slowly shifts the agricultural landscape from nourishment based to market based<a href="#_ftn3">&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;[3]&lt;![endif]&gt;</a>. This transformation introduces a heightened threat of land displacement and land grabbing occurring, as the door opens for corporations to use large scale agriculture as a point of entry<a href="#_ftn4">&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;[4]&lt;![endif]&gt;</a>. Furthermore, as industrial practices begin to overshadow traditional practices, farming activities become consolidated and labour displacement occurs subsequently increasing rural-urban migration. There will be widened inequality as those more equipped to take on the practices of Green Revolution will outpace those who cannot afford to.</p>

<p><strong>Loss of Farmer Independence</strong></p>

<p>A third threat Annan‚Äôs approach presents is the loss of farmer independence. The implementation of a Green Revolution addresses issues of productivity and yield but does not properly mitigate the threats subsequently imposed on the independence of small farmers. Currently, small farming practices are self-sustainable in that farmers preserve their seeds, use traditional hand tools, and require low cost inputs for cultivation. In contrast, the Green Revolution calls for many corporate driven products such as genetically modified seeds, machinery, fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. This creates a farmer dependency on corporations and transforms the farmer role from producer into consumer<a href="#_ftn5">&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;[5]&lt;![endif]&gt;</a>. Furthermore, as new industrial practices begin to be prioritized, the traditional and cultural agriculture practices amongst small farmers begins to be lost.</p>

<p><strong>Health &amp; Biodiversity Genetically Modified Seeds Create Health Implications</strong></p>

<p>A fourth threat Annan‚Äôs approach presents is health &amp; biodiversity repercussions from genetically modified seeds. These seeds are developed with chemicals and toxins that diverges from the natural produce that traditional farmers typically harvest. Although genetically modified foods have not been found to have immediate impact on health, there are postulated long term health risks that emerge from its use and cultivation. By shifting towards these seeds, the Green Revolution introduces the production of food with inconclusive effects into the African diet. In addition to health implications, Genetically Modified organisms also poses a threat to the biodiversity of its environment. As these plants continue to be cultivated and produced, they can overcome the production of preceding indigenous and native crops. Furthermore, as monohybrid crops increase in prevalence the diversity of crops planted diminishes. This reduces the variety in yield and also presents the threat of scarcity to traditional and indigenous crops.</p>

<p><strong>Impact on Environment</strong></p>

<p>A fifth threat Annan‚Äôs approach presents is that the use of chemical intensive resources, such as artificial fertilizers and chemicals, poses negative repercussions for the local environment. The continuous use of these fertilizers overtime degrades the health of the soil and leads to soil pollution<a href="#_ftn6">&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;[6]&lt;![endif]&gt;</a>. Furthermore, runoffs from chemical infused soil can often enter lakes and bodies of water also leading to depreciating water quality<a href="#_ftn7">&lt;![if !supportFootnotes]&gt;[7]&lt;![endif]&gt;</a>. The culminative outcome of these by-products is the deterioration of the environment and ecosystem. With a polluted ecosystem, farmers face long term issues in their agriculture conditions that may need to be addressed with further industrialized solutions. Furthermore, effects on a shared ecosystem affects even farmers that have chosen to not use fertilizers and limits their ability to continue aspects of traditional farming.</p>

<p>Conclusively, although the green revolution indicates a promise of high-yields and productivity, it also presents several threats to traditional farming practices, and agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
