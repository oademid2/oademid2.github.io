The initial craze of NFTs was that they are unique and cannot be copied. While this is true for the fundamental definition of what an NFT is,  [a unique unalterable token that is created and stored on the blockchain,](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/)  it doesn’t necessarily hold true when applied to the most common use case of NFTs, art.

A recurring pain point with NFT Art is that the ownership is decoupled from the art. Art is created off-chain (in photoshop, digital sketch, scanned drawing etc.) but being owned on the chain. You basically have to create the art and then let people know what token the art is tied to.

In context of widespread art distribution, NFTs don’t track the original art file itself as you don’t actually distribute files on most blockchains (which is where ipfs comes in 👀). At some point it’s hard to keep track of who  _has_  the art and who  _owns_  the token. Really the NFT and the ART or only related arbitrarily, just because someone says it is.

My main argument is that although NFTs provide a more visible way to track ownership of digital art, because art and ownership are decoupled, it is difficult to directly attribute ownership**.**

### Could IPFS solve the issues of NFTs?

Right now IPFS, a blockchain solution to file distribution, seems like a starting resolution to the issue of coupling Art to NFTs.  [There’s a great youtube video on how IPFS works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Uj6uR3fp-U&ab_channel=SimplyExplained), but in short — in IPFS you add a file to the IPFS network, it gets a unique hash address/token and multiple people save a copy of that file or parts of that file. So the file and origin of that file is visible to anyone (unlike if it was stored on your laptop or a server where only the owner could access it). In theory, the file is immutable, so if changes are made to that file and it’s re-uploaded, the network keeps track of that — so there is always a true original. Whenever someone wants to get the file they can refer to the unique hash/token and the unique file associated with that hash will be accessible.

To directly compare, when using NFTs alone, you distribute the token and art separately and you have to tell people which token belongs to which art. IPFS automatically ties the token to the art.

### IPFS makes ownership more than just a construct

One important thing to understand about IPFS is that it uses content based addressing instead of location based addressing.

With location based addressing, which is used by traditional storage servers, you access the file based on location. You have to know where the file is located, typically the domain name/IP address of the server, to get access to it. With content based addressing however, you access the file based on what the content is, via the unique hash name, to get access. Essentially. instead of figuring out where the content you want is, all you need to know is what that content is. Though the idea of accessing information based on a long unique sequence of characters seems convoluted, other technologies in crypto infrastructure allow you to resolve the hash key as a domain name (so you people ca just the domain not the hash key) like is currently done with IP addresses for HTTP requests. So file access with IPFS can be considered comparatively simple to Web2 file access.

Since access to the file is not defined on location, that means it can be located anywhere which allows IPFS to operate via distributed nodes (individuals running “microservers”) that consequently decentralizes authority of the file. This means no singular person has authority over its deletion, modifications and access.

Decentralized authority almost seems contradictory to the idea of ownership, after all if a creator uploads an IPFS file to the network and doesn’t have authority over it, how can they be considered the owner? Well ownership isn’t an act, it’s a construct. Ownership means nothing if you can’t prove you created it and can’t prove authenticity. In today’s world people really don’t have authority over the digital art they release anyway. Once they share the image online any one can right-click + save as. At least now there is a way to attribute ownership

I could see something like IPFS becoming a standard protocol like HTTPS. If this occurred as a standard, it would make it easy for people to integrate IPFS content to their websites, articles etc. and create an infrastructure for giving fair and appropriate attribution to content use.

### IPFS still has gaps but it will provide more than the bare minimum

IPFS overall helps with coupling the art to the token/hash address, it doesn’t avoid the problem of duplication. Just like with a standard NFT art you can copy an image and reupload it to the network under a new content hash and claim the unique ownership associated with that token.

I’ve sort of accepted that NFTs aren’t yet a perfect solution to ownership, but being at least  _some_  sort of solution compared to the void of ownership traceability that existed in digital art. In a similar vein, I don’t see IPFS being an immediate perfect solution, but I think IPFS is going to do a lot in shifting NFTs from  _some_  sort of solution for digital art ownership, to a strong solution.]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The pain points of NFTs]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/ipfs_cover.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/ipfs_cover.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Polygon</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/polygon/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Polygon" /><published>2022-03-05T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-03-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/polygon</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/polygon/"><![CDATA[### What is Polygon?

[Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) is a Layer 2 chain for creating Ethereum compatible networks. In simple terms, it allows you to execute smart contracts on its chain that can be transferred with Ethereum, and supports the same for independent chains.

### Why I’m bullish?

###### Polygon is Scalable.

Being a layer 2 network, Polygon solves Ethereum’s biggest issue of [scalability](https://blog.coinbase.com/scaling-ethereum-crypto-for-a-billion-users-715ce15afc0b). As activity on Ethereum increases, it faces high congestion. This has resulted in slower transactions and higher gas fees. As a layer 2 solution, Polygon is able to process transactions of Ethereum’s mainnet while still [holding](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/tech/what-are-layer-2-solutions-and-why-are-they-important)[ ](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/tech/what-are-layer-2-solutions-and-why-are-they-important)[the](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/tech/what-are-layer-2-solutions-and-why-are-they-important)[ ](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/tech/what-are-layer-2-solutions-and-why-are-they-important)[integrity](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/tech/what-are-layer-2-solutions-and-why-are-they-important)[ ](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/tech/what-are-layer-2-solutions-and-why-are-they-important)[of](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/tech/what-are-layer-2-solutions-and-why-are-they-important)[ ](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/tech/what-are-layer-2-solutions-and-why-are-they-important)[Ethereum](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/tech/what-are-layer-2-solutions-and-why-are-they-important)[’](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/tech/what-are-layer-2-solutions-and-why-are-they-important)s block chain.

**Polygon supports a multichain future.**

Polygon’s vision is to provide connectivity between different blockchains and be Ethereum’s internet of blockchains. In essence, it enables blockchains to easily bridge with Ethereum. This is promising because the future of blockchain will likely be multichain and connectivity between different blockchains will improve the user experience. What’s more, Ethereum is one of the most utilized blockchains by developers so strategically there’s a lot of opportunity in being the gateway for other blockchains to integrate with it.

**Polygon emphasizes value of Ethereum.**

outside of its scalability issues, Ethereum already provides significant functionality.  Unlike some layer 1 solutions to Ethereum’s problems (i.e. [Solana](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-solana), [Cardano](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano)), Polygon builds on Ethereum instead of in place of Ethereum. It’s [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/)[ ](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/)[compatible](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) which means that smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum network can be easily deployed on Polygon’s blockchain thus low switching costs. Ethereum is a largely used and trusted network with lots of strong functionalities, it makes sense to leverage this. Betting on Polygon is also betting on Ethereum.

To summarize -- not only does polygon have improved scalability, its low switching costs and EVM compatibility reduces barriers for adoption.

Below is a bit more detail on Polygon’s functionality:

## How does Polygon work?
Polygon uses an adaptation of [Ethereum](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/plasma/)[’](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/plasma/)[s](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/plasma/)[ ](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/plasma/)[Plasma](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/plasma/)[’](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/plasma/)[s](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/plasma/)[ ](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/plasma/)[framework](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/plasma/) which allows transactions to occur off the main Ethereum network and later transferred later to the mainnet. Very simply, transactions will occur on Polygon and be bundled together as one transaction when ready to be carried over to the main Ethereum network. These individual transactions are verified on Polygon as they occur and when returned to Ethereum as a batch, are then verified by Ethereum.

Polygon aims to provide several options for scaling solutions. It’s primary solution is the [PoS](https://finematics.com/polygon-matic-explained/#:~:text=Matic%20PoS%20Chain%20And%20Matic%20Plasma%20Chains&text=Plasma%2C%20in%20essence%2C%20is%20a,for%20building%20scalable%20decentralized%20applications.&text=Matic%20PoS%20Chain%20is%20a,mechanism%20with%20its%20own%20validators)[ ](https://finematics.com/polygon-matic-explained/#:~:text=Matic%20PoS%20Chain%20And%20Matic%20Plasma%20Chains&text=Plasma%2C%20in%20essence%2C%20is%20a,for%20building%20scalable%20decentralized%20applications.&text=Matic%20PoS%20Chain%20is%20a,mechanism%20with%20its%20own%20validators)[chain](https://finematics.com/polygon-matic-explained/#:~:text=Matic%20PoS%20Chain%20And%20Matic%20Plasma%20Chains&text=Plasma%2C%20in%20essence%2C%20is%20a,for%20building%20scalable%20decentralized%20applications.&text=Matic%20PoS%20Chain%20is%20a,mechanism%20with%20its%20own%20validators) which is a permissionless side chain that uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism with it’s own validators, but also relies on Ethereum’s security for validator staking and check points. 


## The 4 layers of Polygon

Overall, [polygon](https://polygon.technology/lightpaper-polygon.pdf#page=9)[ ](https://polygon.technology/lightpaper-polygon.pdf#page=9)[can](https://polygon.technology/lightpaper-polygon.pdf#page=9)[ ](https://polygon.technology/lightpaper-polygon.pdf#page=9)[be](https://polygon.technology/lightpaper-polygon.pdf#page=9)[ ](https://polygon.technology/lightpaper-polygon.pdf#page=9)[broken](https://polygon.technology/lightpaper-polygon.pdf#page=9)[ ](https://polygon.technology/lightpaper-polygon.pdf#page=9)[into](https://polygon.technology/lightpaper-polygon.pdf#page=9)[ 4 ](https://polygon.technology/lightpaper-polygon.pdf#page=9)[layers](https://polygon.technology/lightpaper-polygon.pdf#page=9) -- two mandatory and two optional layers.

![Pic](/assets/pic.png)

The Ethereum layer, the first optional layer, allows Polygon chains to use Ethereum as it’s base layer for things like staking, dispute resolution , messaging and a few other functionalities. The security layer, the second layer, is also optional. It allows chains to add a validation as a service or use Ethereum as a security layer. The third layer is the polygon networks layer where core functions such as transaction collation, local consensus and block production occur. The last layer is the ethereum layer, which is mandatory, and interprets and executes transactions that are included in Polygon’s chains

## The Polygon bridge

The bridge is a key part of Polygon. It is how assets are migrated between layer 2 and Ethereum. There are two implementations offered -- [Plasma](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/ethereum-polygon/plasma/getting-started/#:~:text=A%20bridge%20is%20basically%20a,or%20Proof%20of%20Stake%20bridge.)[ ](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/ethereum-polygon/plasma/getting-started/#:~:text=A%20bridge%20is%20basically%20a,or%20Proof%20of%20Stake%20bridge.)[bridge](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/ethereum-polygon/plasma/getting-started/#:~:text=A%20bridge%20is%20basically%20a,or%20Proof%20of%20Stake%20bridge.) and [PoS](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/ethereum-polygon/pos/getting-started/)[ ](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/ethereum-polygon/pos/getting-started/)[bridge](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/ethereum-polygon/pos/getting-started/).

The Plasma bridge uses a mechanism called [Fraud](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/plasma/#fraud-proofs)[ ](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/plasma/#fraud-proofs)[proofs](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/plasma/#fraud-proofs) for the main chain, Ethereum, to validate the assets being transferred from Polygon. A challenge period of 7 days is required when withdrawing funds which means it will take up to 7 days for funds to be withdrawn unto Ethereum.

With the PoS bridge Proof of stake based assets provides PoS security. Since this security is accepted by users and developers it does not use fraudproffs and allows for a faster exit, up to 30 minutes, with one checkpoint interval.

## In conclusion

Polygon solves Ethereum’s most pressing problem of scalability without directly competing against Ethereum.]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is Polygon?]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/polygon_cover.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/polygon_cover.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Fintech</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/fintech" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fintech" /><published>1000-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>1000-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/fintech</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/fintech"><![CDATA[With technology catapulting the accessibility of financial services in economies such as the U.S. and Canada, the FinTech industry shows promising signs of growth. Intuitively it may seem more practical for investors to focus only on developed and prospering countries but the opportunity for individuals focused on innovation and pioneering an industry could lie in developing countries like Nigeria.

_Need for financial inclusivity_

Only an approximate 30% of Nigerians having access to financial services, presenting a clear need for improved avenues of accessibility. With lack of financial incentive for banks to develop branches outside urban cities, mobile phones are the key to distributing these services. Though popularity of services and products vary throughout wealth levels, one of the largest commonalities in Nigeria is the mobile phone (though the most common models used are very basic) with 84% having a mobile subscription and the market contributing 7.7% to the overall GDP. A majority of those with financial access are included via digital features of their bank account indicating a pull for the accessibility and convenience of FinTech services as it aligns with the trajectory towards financial digitization. Many short comings resulting in a high financial exclusion are addressed in many business models around the world. This coupled with the prevalence of mobile phones with a positive attitude to digital services already ensures a mode of distribution leaving it up to companies to develop a business model that would leverage idea that already exists into low complexity solutions.

_Potential Exists Even Amongst Poverty Line_

Nigeria is one of the most populous countries in the world with 185 million people, creating a consumer base of even a percentage of its upper and middle class would provide companies with sustainable activity. Undeniably, the large presence of poverty calls into question if the remainder of Nigeria's demographic could even translate into frequent financial activity. However, the daily transactions of those well above poverty would be supplemented by frequent money transfers attributed to Nigeria's culture of community dependence. With a large rural to urban immigration and a motivating factor being to support emigrated rural communities, rural migrants frequently require the use of money transfers. The culture of filial responsibility further escalates the need of money transfers within the country amongst those close to the poverty line to support their family members. Additionally, from high density marketplaces to hawkers on almost every road, the exchange of money happens frequently across all income levels. In essence the lack of wealth does not imply a lack of financial service engagement. A Fintech in Nigeria could find contributions from a flourishing middle class in Nigeria culminated with the micro uses of those hovering poverty levels.

_Point of Comparisons_

The success of the Kenyan micro-financial service firm M-Pesa, sets a reasonable expectation as to what the implementation of fintech could look like in Nigeria. Although there is not a complete uniformity between the Kenyan and Nigerian market, the high levels of poverty and financial exclusion prevalent in both countries produces a reasonable point of initial comparison.

The market opportunity for financial accessibility is apparent through M-Pesa’s popularity. As of 2017, it’s transfers accounted for almost half of Kenya’s GDP . Economically, the impact was astounding. A study found that access to the service lifted 2% of Kenyan households from poverty. These comparisons could allude to an (possibly overstated) optimism in the effects of replication in a country such Nigeria. It’s important to understand that while M-pesa’s model is not guaranteed to directly be repeatable, it displays the potential for the leverage of technology to exist within poverty.

Nigeria’s GDP is 5 times greater than that of Kenya’s at $375.8 Billion USD and $74.9 Billion USD respectively. The success of a fintech company is supported by the presence of economic activity associated with a high GDP. If such a business witnessed enough sustainable activity in Kenya, the same can be expected in Nigeria where the GDP is larger.

_Overall Potential_

Companies looking to become industry pioneers could find an untapped market in Nigeria. With a lack of financial accessibility there is a need for technology to be leveraged with financial services. It is important that those entering the market cater to the capacity, while mobile phones are largely used, these entering the market must understand at what level of advancement in technology exists. The ability for a company to successfully cater to the technological capacity, as seen in Kenya’s M-Pesa, can find a way to transform extremely low wealth communities into active engagers of their financial service.]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[With technology catapulting the accessibility of financial services in economies such as the U.S. and Canada, the FinTech industry shows promising signs of growth.
